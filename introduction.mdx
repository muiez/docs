# LeedAB

**Give your AI agents perfect memory.** LeedAB is a simple tool that lets your agents remember important information, learn from interactions, and maintain context across conversations.

## The Problem

AI agents forget everything between conversations. They can't learn from experience, track user preferences, or maintain context. You're stuck managing memory manually.

## The Solution

Add memory to your agent in 3 lines:

```python
# Add memory to any agent
memory = Memory(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
agent = YourAgent(
    tools=[memory.remember, memory.recall]
)

# Agent remembers important context
user: "I prefer morning meetings and hate video calls"
agent: memory.remember("User prefers morning meetings, dislikes video calls")

# Later, agent uses that knowledge
user: "Schedule our sync"
agent: memory.recall("meeting preferences")
agent: "I'll schedule a morning audio call for you"
```

## 5-Minute Integration

```python
from agentmind import Memory

# 1. Initialize memory
memory = Memory(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# 2. Give your agent memory tools
def remember_tool(content: str):
    """Agent decides what to store"""
    return memory.remember(content)

def recall_tool(query: str):
    """Agent searches its memory"""
    return memory.recall(query)

# 3. Let your agent handle the rest
agent = YourAgent(tools=[remember_tool, recall_tool])
```
