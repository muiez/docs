# AgentMind

AgentMind is a powerful memory management system for AI agents. It gives your agents the ability to remember important information, learn from interactions, and maintain context across conversations - all under their autonomous control.

## Why AgentMind?

Your AI agents need memory they can control. AgentMind is a tool you give to your agents, allowing them to decide what to remember, when to remember it, and how to use that knowledge. Instead of you managing context and memory, your agent does it autonomously.

## Quick Example

```python
from agentmind import Memory

# Initialize memory for your agent
memory = Memory(api_key="am_live_YOUR_API_KEY")

# Your agent decides to remember something important
memory.remember("Customer prefers email over phone calls")

# Later, your agent recalls relevant information
context = memory.recall("customer communication preferences")
# Returns: "Customer prefers email over phone calls"
```
