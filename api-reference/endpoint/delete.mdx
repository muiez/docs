## Examples

### Python SDK

```python
from agentmind import Memory

memory = Memory(api_key="am_live_YOUR_API_KEY")

# Delete a specific memory
memory.delete("old_preference")

# Delete with error handling
try:
    memory.delete("temp_session_data")
    print("Memory deleted successfully")
except MemoryNotFoundError:
    print("Memory already deleted or doesn't exist")

# Bulk delete example
memories_to_delete = ["temp_1", "temp_2", "temp_3"]
for mem_id in memories_to_delete:
    memory.delete(mem_id)
```

### REST API

```bash
# Delete a memory
curl -X DELETE https://api.agent-mind.com/v1/memories/old_preference \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_live_YOUR_API_KEY"

# Delete with verbose output
curl -X DELETE https://api.agent-mind.com/v1/memories/temp_session_data \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -v
```

### Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "id": "old_preference",
  "message": "Memory successfully deleted"
}
```

## Bulk Delete

For deleting multiple memories, use the batch endpoint:

### Python SDK

```python
# Delete multiple memories at once
memory.delete_many(["id1", "id2", "id3"])

# Delete by metadata filter
memory.delete_by_filter(
    metadata_filter={"category": "temporary", "expired": True}
)

# Delete by age
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)
memory.delete_before(cutoff_date)
```

### REST API

```bash
# Batch delete
curl -X POST https://api.agent-mind.com/v1/memories/delete-batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "ids": ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
  }'

# Delete by filter
curl -X POST https://api.agent-mind.com/v1/memories/delete-by-filter \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer am_live_YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "metadata_filter": {
      "category": "temporary",
      "session_id": "old_session_123"
    }
  }'
```

## Error Responses

### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "memory_not_found",
    "message": "No memory found with ID 'unknown_id'"
  }
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_api_key",
    "message": "The provided API key is invalid or expired"
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- Deletion is **permanent** and cannot be undone
- Deleting a non-existent memory returns 404, not an error
- Bulk operations are atomic - either all succeed or all fail
- Consider using TTL (time-to-live) for automatic expiration instead of manual deletion
- Deleted memory IDs can be reused after deletion
