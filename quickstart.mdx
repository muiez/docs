## Set Up Your Environment

Learn how to update your LeedAB configuration locally and make sure everything deploys properly.

### Edit and Preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Your Project">
    During onboarding, a GitHub repository containing your LeedAB dashboard code 
    is created. You can find this repository in your 
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repo locally, follow 
    these 
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) 
    from your terminal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview Changes">
    Once cloned, you can preview modifications to ensure your LeedAB dashboard looks 
    and functions correctly. If you have a CLI or local server script, run it at the 
    root of your repository. For example:
    1. Install any necessary dependencies (e.g., `npm install`).
    2. Start your local dev environment (e.g., `npm run dev`) to see real-time updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy Your Changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Set Up Automatic Deployments">
    You can configure a CI/CD pipeline or use a GitHub app for automatic deployments 
    every time you push changes. Check your 
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) for quick setup guides. Once linked, 
    you should see a successful check mark next to your commit hash if everything 
    deployed correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push Your Updates">
    After you've committed all changes, 
    [push your code to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push). 
    Monitor your build or deployment logs to ensure the new version of your LeedAB 
    dashboard is up-to-date. If for some reason the automatic deployment fails, you 
    can trigger a manual update through the 
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

## Update Your Dashboard

LeedAB uses modern web components (MDX or React-based, if applicable) to customize
